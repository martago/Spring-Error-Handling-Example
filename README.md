# Spring Error Handling Example
## Description
This is my small example project to test swagger & springboot error handling.
For this reason I created a fictional example to examine it.

The fictional example was (Gas price Calculator):
- create a RESTResource for adding bills
- check the bills
- manage error handling

## Usage
start the MainApplication and test the error handling via swagger.

## Swagger Documentation
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
- use this link to test the rest endpoints
